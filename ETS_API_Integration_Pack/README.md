## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

### Smart Contacts Structure:
```
ETS (Head Office) - UUID: 971d644f-d6a8-479c-a901-1f9b0425d7bb
â”œâ”€â”€ ALL INVOICING HANDLED HERE
â””â”€â”€ Site (e.g., QML - Murwillumbah)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Physical Location (where work happens)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Company Contacts (people at this site)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Site Contact (role: JOB)
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Property Manager (role: Property Manager) - optional
    â””â”€â”€ Jobs
        â””â”€â”€ NO BILLING CONTACTS - invoices flow to ETS automatically
```

### The Process:
1. **Checks/Creates Site** - Links to ETS (UUID: 971d644f-d6a8-479c-a901-1f9b0425d7bb)
2. **Adds Company Contacts** - People associated with the site
3. **Creates Job** - Linked to site with ETS PO attached
4. **Links Job Contacts** - Site Contact, Property Manager (no billing)

## âœ… What This Solves

- **Billing Separation** - Corporate billing address separate from job location
- **Contact Management** - All contact types properly attached
- **Smart Contacts** - Proper hierarchy for invoice routing
- **Duplicate Prevention** - Checks for existing sites

## ðŸ”‘ Important Notes

### API Key Security:
- Never share your API key
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate keys regularly

### Billing Address:
- Set at SITE level (not job level)
- ServiceM8 handles separation at invoice time
- Include billing instructions in work_done_description

### Contact Types:
- Site Contact must use type "JOB"
- Only 3 types work: JOB, Property Manager, BILLING
- Add contacts AFTER job creation
