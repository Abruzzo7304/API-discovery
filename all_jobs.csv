Attached is standardized Quote for your consideration. Quote is based on standard installation on single story building with tin roof. Batteries and inverter would require a suitable location for installation for exsample an attached double garage.   

We propose to install a 6kW Sungrow Hybrid inverter with 18 x Canadian Solar 415W panels with total of 7.4kW PV capacity. An additional 9.6 kWh Sungrow battery bank is itemized within the Quote.    

The Sungrow inverter includes single phase energy meter and isolators and the battery cabinet is prewired 

Please note: Any upgrades to Switchboard or wiring to accomodate solar install will come at additional cost. 

Please contact your energy retailer after installation to arrange your meter upgrade to a smart meter.

Maintain the power to the existing RFS shelter until RFS equipment is successfully  relocated to NSWTA Hut.
Prior to doing this the NSWTA shelter will be tested and fully accepted by NSWTA. 

We will provide power to the NSWTA Hut by modifying the MSB so that two separate circuit breakers can co-exist  feeding the RFS and TA Hut via the existing RFS meter. This will involve an additional mobilisation, outage for approx. one hour to reconfigure the wiring in MSB for the new arrangement. 
 
Note the ownership of the existing RFS Meter will be transferred to NSWTA as part of this build scope.

RFS Temp Power
Maintain the power to the existing RFS shelter until RFS equipment is successfully  relocated to NSWTA Hut. Prior to doing this the NSWTA shelter will be tested and fully accepted by NSWTA. 

We will provide power to the NSWTA Hut by modifying the MSB so that two separate circuit breakers can co-exist  feeding the RFS and TA Hut via the existing RFS meter. This will involve an additional mobilisation, outage for approx. one hour to reconfigure the wiring in MSB for the new arrangement. 
 
Note the ownership of the existing RFS Meter will be transferred to NSWTA as part of this build scope.

- Install new domestic Meter box / DB on RHS of the MSB this will include: 
New 80A - 4 Pole Gen C/O switch to allow Dry rm 4&5 to be run on generator supply for load shedding.  
The existing generator C/O switch will continue to work as was.
Install 2 new 50A 3P C/B for dying rm circuits.
Leave Solar and Main Switch as is.
- Extend Dry rm 5 circuit back to new DB mentioned above. 
Rewire Dry rm 4 to 16mm cable and extend to new DB. 

 - Install new 150mm cable ladder from DB factory to MSB for new circuits as the existing tray is overloaded adding to over heating and derating problems.

The benefit of doing this job are:
- The solar inverters will feed Dry rm 4&5 but will not be back fed from the generator
- Gen change over switch for dry rms will be located in new meter box Adj to existing.
- Dry rm load will be removed from DB factory preventing tripping 80A CB
- Upgraded dry rm 4 cable will prevent over hearting and over loading of circuit cable.
- De clutter the MSB by relocating C/B's to new domestic meter box.","2023-02-21 16:35:41","2023-02-24 07:54:07","2023-03-01 15:21:55","12465.1500",12465.15,"2023-03-09 00:00:00","Xero","f9634b73-d5b7-4798-903b-1f4c53242e9b","aa8df125-2033-423b-8d0b-1f4b7363de8b",1,"2479","NSW","Bangalow"

Byron Bay NSW 2481","2/130 Jonson St,
Byron Bay NSW 2481","Following our  7 day power monitoring and site inspection I have the following to report:

During the period 12/4-18/4, we observed average current in the Orbit Tenancy was between 40-50A, however on 14th and on 18th April the maximum current peaked around 95Amps per phase

The building consumer mains was measured on 18-20th April with the peaks ranging between 125A and 145A. The cable being 70mm 4C+E XLPE which protected by 125-160A service protective device (SPD trip settings unknown) is at its limit.  As such he overall building load should be considered and not be increased with out further investigation.

The Orbit sub-mains consist of 10mm 4C+E O/C which is installed in underground conduit. This is rated to 63A and is protected by a 63A 3 phase breaker.  The sub-main breaker is tripping occasionally due to over-current which is not acceptable consistant electrical overload presents a fire risk.

Recommendations:
Option A

To remedy this situation would require upgrading the building, main switchboard to CT metering (over 100A, and upgrade the sub-mains to the Orbit tenancy.  This would allow for an increase in supply to meet your needs. Ideally Orbit tenancy is suited to a 150A supply via CT metering and upgraded sub-mains.
Cost Estimate is somewhere between $50-70k. 

Option B
An interim fix is to get additional power from the lawyers tenancy next door which you occupy part of. This would involve:

1. Upgrade the tenancy sub-mains and circuit protection. Approx $2,800
2. Upgrade the lawyers main switchboard to accomodate additional power load, approx $1,800
3. Install a second sub-main to Orbit tenancy with a new sub-board fed from the lawyers supply, approx $2,000
4. Rewire 2 existing machines to the new sub-board. approx $1,900
Approx total for option B would be $8500 +gst

This is only an estimate. We can provide a fixed quote on your direction to go ahead. 

Notes
-Orbit DB currently tripping at high load. Check for faults and calculate loads for current equipment and future needs.
-Complete site inspection and return trip to install 3-Phase Power Quality & Energy Analyser power monitoring to Orbit dry cleaning and return trip to transfer power monitoring to building mains.
-This information is necessary to work out how to best distribute the increased load between Orbit tenancy and 2nd power supply from solicitors distribution board.
-Labour cost include initial site visit and three return trips to install Analyser to Orbit, transfer to mains and remove.

- Upgrade Consumer mains from 25mm to 50mm XLPE 3 phase using the existing 50mm conduit under slab. 
Note It is not guaranteed that this will be successful due to unexpected issues that could arise with the U/G conduit such as deformity in or excessive bends.
I expect the job to be successful based on my Past experience of doing this many times. In the unlikely event the cable upgrade is not successful then on the same day we will have to roll back to the original cable.  Should that occur then full the quoted price will be charged as the cable is a special cut which can not be returned and labour spent.
Plan B would be to cut the concrete and upgrade the U/G conduit then the cable could be used to complete the job.

- L2 Disconnect / Reconnect over 100A supply. Includes co-ordinated shut down with agreement from effected neighbours.
If Essential street outage is required that will be at extra cost.

RFS Temp Power
Maintain the power to the existing RFS shelter until RFS equipment is successfully  relocated to NSWTA Hut. Prior to doing this the NSWTA shelter will be tested and fully accepted by NSWTA. 

We will provide power to the NSWTA Hut by modifying the MSB so that two separate circuit breakers can co-exist  feeding the RFS and TA Hut via the existing RFS meter. This will involve an additional mobilisation, outage for approx. one hour to reconfigure the wiring in MSB for the new arrangement. 
 
Note the ownership of the existing RFS Meter will be transferred to NSWTA as part of this build scope.

- Upgrade Consumer mains from 25mm to 50mm XLPE 3 phase using the existing 50mm conduit under slab. 
Note It is not guaranteed that this will be successful due to unexpected issues that could arise with the U/G conduit such as deformity in or excessive bends.
I expect the job to be successful based on my Past experience of doing this many times. In the unlikely event the cable upgrade is not successful then on the same day we will have to roll back to the original cable.  Should that occur then full the quoted price will be charged as the cable is a special cut which can not be returned and labour spent.
Plan B would be to cut the concrete and upgrade the U/G conduit then the cable could be used to complete the job.

- L2 Disconnect / Reconnect over 100A supply. Includes co-ordinated shut down with agreement from effected neighbours.
If Essential street outage is required that will be at extra cost.

Lismore NSW 2480","Description of  Issues:

-Due to the upgrade of the oven/stove unfortunately there has to be an upgrade to the consumer mains and current switchboard. 

Description of works required:

- Swap out of Gas stove to Electric Stove increases load.
-The new stove requires  no less than a 32a RCBO and 6mm cable installed to supply the load.

-Current consumer mains to house is supplied by 6mm cable. Requires upgrade
 
-Connecting new oven to the existing consumer mains could cause burn out and potentially a fire.

-To ensure a safe and complaint installation we propose to upgrade existing consumer mains and current switchboard.

-In the process of upgrading the existing electrical installation we would install RCBOs for every subcircuit making the house safe and compliant.

Quote includes:

- Level 2 disconnect and reconnect
- Upgrade of consumer mains
- Upgrade of Main Earth to current standards
- Installation of RCBO safety switches
- Installation of stove/cooktop
- Labour & Materials

Lismore NSW 2480","Description of  Issues:
-Due to the upgrade of the oven/stove unfortunately there has to be an upgrade to the consumer mains and current switchboard. 
Description of works required:
- Swap out of Gas stove to Electric Stove increases load.
-The new stove requires  no less than a 32a RCBO and 6mm cable installed to supply the load.
-Current consumer mains to house is supplied by 6mm cable. Requires upgrade:
-Connecting new oven to the existing consumer mains could cause burn out and potentially a fire.
-To ensure a safe and complaint installation we propose to upgrade existing consumer mains and current switchboard.
-In the process of upgrading the existing electrical installation we would install RCBOs for every subcircuit making the house safe and compliant.
Quote includes:
- Level 2 disconnect and reconnect
- Upgrade of consumer mains
- Upgrade of Main Earth to current standards
- Installation of RCBO safety switches
- Installation of stove/cooktop
- Labour & Materials

TERMS: $2000 deposit upon acceptance of quote. $1000 at completion of work. Balance paid 14 days after completion.

Single storey tin roof (old tile roof being replaced).
Inverter to go sth side 15m away from MB

Bailey has been to site. Notes:
""AC run: 24m board to inverter
Battery location: on the southern wall underneath inverter
DC run: should be fairly straightforward.
Access is good.
WiFi router right behind inverter location
9 panels and inverter to be removed - straightforward
Old panels will need cleaning if being reused (factored in to pricing; 1 hour of labour for 1 person)
Can't guarantee the racking from the old panels will be reusable (have factored in new racking to pricing)
All the panels tested well, so they're fine to re-use.""
Will need existing 9 panels removed in early-mid June. Once roof replaced (with colorbond) in mid-June, team to reinstall existing SunPower panels with opti's, together with new panels, opti's, battery, etc
Bailey didn't realise the roof was being replaced with colorbond, so he's said they'll measure again once the new roof is on to confirm panel placement

The meter box is on the southern side of the house

1.Circuits in the main switchboard (quick lag board) will need to be re wired into Gateway for back up. 
2.Gateway has only 6mm 3 phase supply to it with the battery circuit breaker connected in the non-back up section in the Gateway.
3.We will need to upgrade the feed to the Gateway to 16mm, as the customer wants 7 circuits connected to back up 2 x 16a and 5x 20amps and the circuit breakers.
4.The current 6mm feeding the Gateway would trip the back-up main switch under non back up conditions (he is also aware of the battery only pulling 5kw of discharge during back-up mode and knows only to use minimal usage during a blackout). 
5.2 light circuits and 5 power circuits (1, 5, 10, 14, 16, 25 and 27) on circuit labelling.
6.These circuits will need to be extended about 2m to the gateway and upgraded to RCBOs (all quicklag circuit breakers).

-Bellingen PS FDT cable is faulty. 
-Contact SC Luke Rampling (0448 098 174) 

Description of works required:

-existing cabling repairs (if possible) or replace the existing cable with new 4-pair Cat-6 UTP data cable at Bellingen PS. 
-Understand from Tan that the existing Front Door Telephone (FDT) cable is faulty at the Bellingen PS .
- It will need to be repaired or replaced; unsure what exactly has happened to it (damaged?). 
 
-If it needs to be replaced, I strongly recommend to replace it with a 4-pair Cat-6 (at least) UTP cable. FDT is analogue and is virtually obsolete; it works on 2-pair phone cable. Since 2023, NSWPF has started using Video Front Door Phone (VFDP). VFDP needs 4-pair data cable. VFDP is an IP phone with a built-in camera; it takes the photo of the person who pressed the phone button and the officer can see (or capture the photo of) the person at the receiving end. The VFDP costs around $1,500. Installation costs of VFDP are additional.

After investigating the site I have found that the two Cameras with faults are connected to an old NVR in the Foyer along with two other cameras that do not display on the New Hikvision NVR. The Old NVR is acting as  PoE network switch for the old cameras in the foyer.
Both of these cameras are programmed to the hikvision NVR as ONVIF cameras and are therefor unable to have all parameters changed for the hikvision NVR to accept the correct resolution. this results in the cameras dropping out. 

Price is to remove the Old NVR from candy bar foyer, and re-cable all four existing camera locations, back to the main Cabinet. a junction point may be required in the candy bar where  any new cabling is unable to be concealed in the ceiling or pulled through with existing cables. Supply and Install four new 6MP mini dome cameras to these locations 

All Cabling and connections to Australian Standards.

Automatic Door Quote required to upgrade automatic Door operator. It has been reported that the motor gearbox is noisy and not holding charge. Please quote to upgrade this auto door operator mechanism to rectify the issue. Contact Gemma Crompton 0481 916 818

Notes from site inspection 17.5.24 Refer to images

Door last serviced April 2023 by Thearl electrical (potentially the test and tag)

Disconnecting power source immediately drops power to door. Replacement battery required. Once battery is replaced correct charging amps from controller can be tested. If charging amps are not correct the battery will not hold charge it would be indicative that the controller isn't recharging the battery and require replacement at additional costs.

- Test and commission prior to job completion and check with NSWTA Tech/Engineers the site operational status. 
- NB: If  Jinko 370 is not available, a similar panel will need to be supplied and the entire string effected will need to be replaced.

MOP:
- Prepare Safe Work Method Statement before job commencement.
- Ensure inductions undertaken and staff appropriately qualified and trained
- Ensure road access safe and access authorized prior to departure.
- Upon arrival whole crew to review, revise and sign off on SWMS 
- Access compound and note exclusion zones including tower, RF zones and unauthorized areas. Confirm ground is firm and free of obstacles prior to using EWP
- Confirm isolation of affected DC strings via labels and testing, when confirmed lock off DC strings isolation switches at marshalling box.
- Barricade work areas before work on platform ladders/ EWP if others in area. Conduct EWP safety pre checks
- Set up Platform ladders / EWP adjacent panel array and remove any cable fixings to facilitate damaged panel removal. Use spotter during EWP use and to secure ladder base.
- Loosen panel clamps and remove panels from ground/ platform ladders where possible. Use a harness and lanyard to array racking anchor points if required (but not whilst using EWP).
- Remove damaged panels using EWP and multiple personnel to transfer the load to the ground. Store panels in a secure place for disposal. 
- Install new panels onto ground mount frame replacing damaged ones. Ensure panels are securely fastened and earthed via mid /end clamps and earth weebs.
- Re-connect the DC under panels and re-fasten cable wiring system with SS cable ties and PVC cable ties.
- Double check and test string wiring arrangement and connections. Ensure correct polarity, DC open string voltage, IR test and earth leakage.
- When testing passed re-energise and test for correct operation of DC strings and inverter operation
- Stack damaged panels into trailer and for disposal and clean any rubbish from site
- Secure compound and advise site representative of work completion

Note:
- Works can be conducted safely without HF technician in attendance providing we obey restricted areas and have access to appropriate areas of site.
- The site can generally remain live during the entire process with isolation to take place on the DC strings at the marshalling box.

- Confirm isolation of affected DC strings via labels and testing, when confirmed lock off DC strings isolation switches at marshalling box.
- Barricade work areas before work on platform ladders/ EWP if others in area. Conduct EWP safety pre checks
- Set up Platform ladders / EWP adjacent panel array and remove any cable fixings to facilitate damaged panel removal. Use spotter during EWP use and to secure ladder base.
- Loosen panel clamps and remove panels from ground/ platform ladders where possible. Use a harness and lanyard to array racking anchor points if required (but not whilst using EWP).
- Remove damaged panels using EWP and multiple personnel to transfer the load to the ground. Store panels in a secure place for disposal. 
- Install new panels onto ground mount frame replacing damaged ones. Ensure panels are securely fastened and earthed via mid /end clamps and earth weebs.
- Re-connect the DC under panels and re-fasten cable wiring system with SS cable ties and PVC cable ties.
- Double check and test string wiring arrangement and connections. Ensure correct polarity, DC open string voltage, IR test and earth leakage.
- When testing passed re-energise and test for correct operation of DC strings and inverter operation
- Stack damaged panels into trailer and for disposal and clean any rubbish from site
- Secure compound and advise site representative of work completion

Note
- Works can be conducted safely without HF technician in attendance providing we obey restricted areas and have access to appropriate areas of site.
- The site can generally remain live during the entire process with isolation to take place on the DC strings at the marshalling box.

Caro's Notes;
Paul Smith from PRS has already been to site and confirmed that the tank will go below the bathroom (which will eliminate the dead leg to the bathroom)

John and Vicki currently have gas HW

I don't have any photos of the job, but Paul will have some and he is aware of what's involved in completing the job, given he's been to site.

The Redback inverter includes single phase energy meter and isolators and the battery cabinet is prewired 

Please note: Any upgrades to Switchboard or wiring to accomodate solar install will come at additional cost. 

Please contact your energy retailer after installation to arrange your meter upgrade to a smart meter.

Caro's Notes;
Paul Smith from PRS has already been to site and confirmed that the tank will go below the bathroom (which will eliminate the dead leg to the bathroom)

John and Vicki currently have gas HW

I don't have any photos of the job, but Paul will have some and he is aware of what's involved in completing the job, given he's been to site.

We can get our electrician to do the electrical circuitry for the relocation but we could use a temp extension lead as its a 10 amp supply by look of it","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00","2024-07-17 00:00:00","385.0000",385,"2024-07-16 00:00:00","Xero","6f911e74-d4a5-4b2b-802b-218d25b44d9b","ee706f5a-c7ef-4181-b970-20f6904d0eeb",1,"2515","NSW","Austinmer"

Electrical Make Safe
ELECTRICAL
Please contact the insured and schedule an attendance to the property to carry out a safety check and make safe to the
affected electricals in the lounge room area. If required, please disconnect/isolate only. No repairs to be carried out until
further approval is provided by RCC.
Please test any affected power outlets, light fittings or GPOs in the affected areas to ensure the property does not have any
electrical safety concerns. Thank you for your assistance.
Cause of Damage: Contact made with the insured who confirmed the water pipe under the sink in the bedroom ensuite
burst in the middle of the night, causing flooding in the master bedroom, hallway, and lounge room. The insured promptly
shut off the water at the mains upon waking and becoming aware of the issue. She is uncertain whether water has infiltrated
the walls of the living room and bathroom. The vanity has become waterlogged, and water has damaged several rugs as
well as the base of her bed. A plumber attended to the situation this morning and will provide a report for submission this
afternoon to insured. The plumber has also repaired the leak, and the insured has retained the old connections that burst
for the assessor's review.
Additionally, the insured noted that she had to switch off power cords, as water entered the lounge room and affected cords
behind a side table connected to her items. The cords were submerged in water, and the insured is uncomfortable using
them until they have been thoroughly inspected.
Please complete the site report link(attached in the email) within 24hrs of attendance, and upload a minimum of 10
supporting photographs. This is a requirement in order to finalize your invoice. Thank you.

Energy Renewal Tender:
TPS is seeking to form a select panel of 5 suppliers from the Prequalification Scheme for General Construction Works Valued up to $1 million (SCM0256) to renew the existing Stand-Alone Power Systems (SAPS) in the Royal National Park (Wattamolla and Garie Visitor Precincts). 
Tender and delivery indicative timeframe – mandatory Tender Briefing will be held on site in late January 2025 (details confirmed within tender invite) with the proposed contracted works to be completed by no later 30 June 2025.

 

The renewal of the of the existing SAPS for the Wattamolla and Garie Visitor Precincts as a result of the increasing maintenance costs, increased fuel costs due to longer running times of the backup diesel generators due to battery decay and overall higher system demand resulting from rising visitation.

 

The contract will be completed in a two staged approach

Stage 1 DESIGN – lump sum to complete detailed inspection & investigation including design of each SAPS renewal needs
Stage 2 INSTALLATION – based on the renewal needs from Stage 1 a schedule of rates will be used to facilitate the works
 

The scope of works is the same for both locations (not limited to)

Each location has a Stand-Alone Power System (SAPS) – solar panels, inverters, battery back-up and supported by a diesel generator when the level of the batteries drop.
Some of the equipment is reaching the end of their life (Garie installed in 2009 Wattamolla in 2017).
Each company will need to test existing systems and determine the life cycle of each element and if they need to be replaced / upgrade.
NPWS want the capacity increased to cater for future needs.
Several background reports have been undertaken, which will be provided to the tenderers.
Tenderers will be required to design and install the upgrade SAPS.
Works will be completed under an MW21 Contract.
 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

He would like Sustaine to conduct a site visit asap to:
- assess the current system to determine if it needs an upgrade or replacement - or extension (more panels, plus a battery)
- essentially determine the optimal solution to meet their future energy needs

76 Howards Rd, Burringbar NSW 2483","223 Tweed Valley Way
South Murwillumbah NSW 2484","Proposed Timeline (Rough Estimate from Darren):

October – Master bedroom side of the house: general lights and power

November – Kitchen end of the house: general lights and power

January 2026 – Top paddock: guesthouse/shed

Obviously these dates are rough at this stage, but they give us a working framework.

Planning Discussion

I think it’s important we schedule a proper sit-down with Darren and his wife—ideally with a floor plan (even a basic sketch) to go over everything thoroughly:

What they want installed or upgraded

What existing infrastructure is staying or being removed (e.g., A/C)

What we can lock in, knowing some details will likely evolve

This would give us a solid foundation and help eliminate confusion later on.

Rewire Opportunity

I haven’t brought this up with Darren yet, but a full rewire of the house is worth considering. The current roof space wiring is well below standard—completely non-compliant. Given he wants to remove the kitchen ceiling and convert it to a vaulted ceiling (where much of the dodgy wiring is), it's the perfect time to address this properly.

Solar/Battery/Genset System

There seems to be a bit of a disconnect between Darren’s understanding of the system and what’s actually in place—high chance the confusion stems from me!

Regardless, I think it would be valuable for Josh to spend whatever time is needed onsite to map out the entire system and identify what’s done vs. what’s still required.

We should also aim to compile full handover documentation for the system, including:

Wiring diagrams

Warranties

Service schedules/recommendations (potential opportunity for us)

Step-by-step user guides

A flowchart showing how the system behaves under different conditions (e.g., backup sequences)

If the system isn’t currently 100% automatic, we’ll need to scope and quote for an ATS (Automatic Transfer Switch) and make a call on that with Darren.

Also, he’s keen for the backup system to eventually support the guesthouse/shed in the top paddock. We’ll need to assess if the current setup can handle that or if upgrades are necessary.

As you mentioned, Dale—there might be a great opportunity here to propose a completely off-grid solution for that part of the property.","2025-09-12 10:07:15","2025-09-12 10:10:11","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0.0000",0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","","971d644f-d6a8-479c-a901-1f9b0425d7bb","d855e5b3-4ae7-4f4b-91a8-1f5344d82c2b",1,"2483","NSW","Burringbar"

•	We have returned to site and completed works as requested.
•	These works were also not quoted in and this should be raised as additional works to NSWTA.
•	Seeking guidance as to sending a variation invoice. Should I use previous PO number or would you like an invoice to present to NSWTA?
