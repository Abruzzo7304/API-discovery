    "job_description": "Proposed Timeline (Rough Estimate from Darren):\n\nOctober – Master bedroom side of the house: general lights and power\n\nNovember – Kitchen end of the house: general lights and power\n\nJanuary 2026 – Top paddock: guesthouse/shed\n\nObviously these dates are rough at this stage, but they give us a working framework.\n\nPlanning Discussion\n\nI think it’s important we schedule a proper sit-down with Darren and his wife—ideally with a floor plan (even a basic sketch) to go over everything thoroughly:\n\nWhat they want installed or upgraded\n\nWhat existing infrastructure is staying or being removed (e.g., A/C)\n\nWhat we can lock in, knowing some details will likely evolve\n\nThis would give us a solid foundation and help eliminate confusion later on.\n\nRewire Opportunity\n\nI haven’t brought this up with Darren yet, but a full rewire of the house is worth considering. The current roof space wiring is well below standard—completely non-compliant. Given he wants to remove the kitchen ceiling and convert it to a vaulted ceiling (where much of the dodgy wiring is), it's the perfect time to address this properly.\n\nSolar/Battery/Genset System\n\nThere seems to be a bit of a disconnect between Darren’s understanding of the system and what’s actually in place—high chance the confusion stems from me!\n\nRegardless, I think it would be valuable for Josh to spend whatever time is needed onsite to map out the entire system and identify what’s done vs. what’s still required.\n\nWe should also aim to compile full handover documentation for the system, including:\n\nWiring diagrams\n\nWarranties\n\nService schedules/recommendations (potential opportunity for us)\n\nStep-by-step user guides\n\nA flowchart showing how the system behaves under different conditions (e.g., backup sequences)\n\nIf the system isn’t currently 100% automatic, we’ll need to scope and quote for an ATS (Automatic Transfer Switch) and make a call on that with Darren.\n\nAlso, he’s keen for the backup system to eventually support the guesthouse/shed in the top paddock. We’ll need to assess if the current setup can handle that or if upgrades are necessary.\n\nAs you mentioned, Dale—there might be a great opportunity here to propose a completely off-grid solution for that part of the property.",
