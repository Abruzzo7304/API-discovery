The current roof space wiring is well below standard\u2014completely non-compliant. Given he wants to remove the kitchen ceiling and convert it to a vaulted ceiling (where much of the dodgy wiring is), it's the perfect time to address this properly.\n\nSolar/Battery/Genset System\n\nThere seems to be a bit of a disconnect between Darren\u2019s understanding of the system and what\u2019s actually in place\u2014high chance the confusion stems from me!\n\nRegardless, I think it would be valuable for Josh to spend whatever time is needed onsite to map out the entire system and identify what\u2019s done vs. what\u2019s still required.\n\nWe should also aim to compile full handover documentation for the system, including:\n\nWiring diagrams\n\nWarranties\n\nService schedules/recommendations (potential opportunity for us)\n\nStep-by-step user guides\n\nA flowchart showing how the system behaves under different conditions (e.g., backup sequences)\n\nIf the system isn\u2019t currently 100% automatic, we\u2019ll need to scope and quote for an ATS (Automatic Transfer Switch) and make a call on that with Darren.\n\nAlso, he\u2019s keen for the backup system to eventually support the guesthouse/shed in the top paddock. We\u2019ll need to assess if the current setup can handle that or if upgrades are necessary.\n\nAs you mentioned, Dale\u2014there might be a great opportunity here to propose a completely off-grid solution for that part of the property.",
